# Get Dump & Restore Databases
Through this pipeline and script, you can generate backups from existing databases in PostgreSQL, includingtheir creation dates. Using the "dump" tag, you can create backups.
Additionally, you can restore the backups created from the existing databases, either on the same server oron another server with the same version of PostgreSQL.
The "restore" tag allows you to restore the latest backup based on the backup date.
